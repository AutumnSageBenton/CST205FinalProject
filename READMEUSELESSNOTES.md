Be sure it is unzipped and inside a folder with a virtual enviroment

Getting your machine set up in the command line:
  
  Install Flask packages by pasting the below into the command line

  Paste the below into the command line to run the application


  $env:FLASK_APP = â€œmain.py"

  flask run



Opening the application: 

  
  After a few seconds the operating system will display some text in the command line. 
  
  Find the line that states "Running on ..." 
  
  Copy the web address, it will look something like this (http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
  
  Paste it into a web engine and press enter
  
  You will then be brought to a login page
  
  Being your first time using this, you will not have an account
  
  Navigate to the top left of the page and click 'sign up'
  
  Create an account with your credentials and begin creating useless notes!
  
  If you run the program again, you can simply login to your existing account or create a new one
